## Instructions: 	&#129499; 	&#129499;&#8205;&#9792;
### 1. 👇🏻Register yourself for Hacktoberfest 2021
###### Link to register: [hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)

###### See more details at: [hacktoberfest.netlify.com](https://hacktoberfest.netlify.com/)
###### Go to our repo by clicking here -  [https://github.com/BasicNik/Basic-Codes-](https://github.com/BasicNik/Basic-Codes-)

### 3. 👇🏻Star and Fork this Repository
###### 	&#9728; You can star ⭐ and fork this repository on GitHub by navigating at the top of this repository.
###### 	&#9728; GitHub repository URLs will reference both the username associated with the owner of the repository, as well as the repository name.
###### 	&#9728;  When you’re on the main page for the repository, you’ll see a button to "Star" and “Fork” the repository on your upper right-hand side of the page, underneath your user icon.

### 4. 👇🏻Clone the Repository
###### &#9728;   To make your own local copy of the repository you would like to contribute to, let’s first open up a terminal window.
###### &#9728;   We’ll use the `git clone`  command along with the URL that points to your fork of the repository.
###### &#9728;   This URL will be similar to the URL above, except now it will end with `.git`. In the example above, the URL will look like this:
[https://github.com/BasicNik/Basic-Codes-](https://github.com/BasicNik/Basic-Codes-)
###### &#9728;   You can alternatively copy the URL by using the green “Clone or download” button from your repository page that you just forked from the original repository page. Once you click the button, you’ll be able to copy the URL by clicking the binder button next to the URL.
###### &#9728;   Once we have the URL, we’re ready to clone the repository. To do this, we’ll combine the git clone command with the repository URL from the command line in a terminal window:
`https://github.com/BasicNik/Basic-Codes-`

### 5. 👇🏻Create a New Branch
####
#### and add in and add in the Data Structures and Algorithms folder the algorithm you want

#### and add in and add in the Data Structures and Algorithms folder the algorithm you want

### 6. 👇🏻Update Local Repository
###### &#9728;  While working on a project alongside other contributors, it is important for you to keep your local repository up-to-date with the project as you don’t want to make a pull request for code that will cause conflicts. To keep your local copy of the code base updated, you’ll need to sync changes.
###### &#9728;  We’ll first go over configuring a remote for the fork, then syncing the fork.

### 9. 👇🏻Create Pull Request
###### At this point, you are ready to make a pull request to the original repository.
###### Now navigate to your forked repository, and press the “New pull request” button on your left-hand side of the page.

## &#127984; &#127984; Hurray!!! You just got closer to completing your hacktoberfest challenge. 😃

# 😎🙏 Thanks for you contribution
